This example is Hello World example of Teiid, where data from a database (MariaDB aka MySQL) and CSV file are integrated using Teiid. Teiid then provides relational access layer on top of this integration.

In this example you will learn
 - How to pull MariaDB docker image and add some tables
 - How to pull Teiid docker image and integrate data from MariaDB and CSV file
 - Run the Docker container 
 - Run a JDBC client to access the Teiid engine started in a Docker container you created.
 
Until I learn to use SWARM or Kubernetes , the receipe.txt file has all the command to follow to run the example
